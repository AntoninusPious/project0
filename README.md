This project is an internal website for our printing and design company.
 The purpose of the site is to provide an interface for employees to access job tickets,
 create new work orders and access customer tables.

The site consists of five main pages. The index displays recent job ticket information.
There is an initial login page that will allow users to login using database credentials.

All form items will eventually be connected to the company database, which I am designing separately.


The "create new job ticket" page has a form that will access the job ticket database
  and will pass the information entered to a new database entry.

The "search job tickets" page has a form that allows employees to search
  job tickets based on key search fields, i.e job ID#, customer name, customer phone number, etc.

The "search customers" page is similar to the search job tickets page, but will only search the
  customer listings.

The site has three .css files: bootstrap, master, and variables.
